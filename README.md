# WhizQuiz - AI-Powered Multiplayer Quiz Platform

> WhizQuiz is a full-stack web application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically generate quizzes on various topics. It features a real-time, event-driven architecture to support multiple concurrent players in a live game session. This project was built to explore the integration of generative AI within a scalable, low-latency multiplayer environment.

## Core Features
- **Dynamic Quiz Generation**: Utilizes the OpenAI API (via LangChain) to generate quiz questions and answers on demand for 10 diverse topics.

- **Real-Time Multiplayer Sessions**: Supports 1000+ concurrent users with a WebSocket-based, event-driven backend for synchronized game state and minimal latency.

- **Live Leaderboard**: Employs a Max-Heap data structure for efficient, real-time updates to the player leaderboard, ensuring O(log n) complexity on score changes.

- **Responsive UI**: A mobile-first, responsive interface built with Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS.

- **Secure Session Management**: Manages active quiz rooms using a Hash Map for O(1) average time complexity on lookups and uses unique 6-character room codes for easy sharing.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using a modern, type-safe stack designed for performance and scalability.

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - App Router
- **TypeScript** - Language
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling

### Backend
- **Node.js** - The asynchronous powerhouse for our real-time APIs and game logic
- **PostgreSQL** - Reliable and powerful Database
- **Prisma ORM** 
- **LLM API Integration** - LangChain.js to interface with LLM APIs for content generation.
- **WebSockets** - Real-Time Communication, live game logic and player synchronization.

## Algorithms and Data Structures Used
To ensure WhizQuiz is efficient and performs well, especially in a real-time multiplayer environment, several key computer science algorithms and data structures are used:

### Max-Heap for the Live Leaderboard

How it's used: A Max-Heap (often implemented as a Priority Queue) is perfect for managing the live leaderboard. The player with the highest score is always at the root, allowing for constant-time retrieval of the top player. When scores are updated, the heap is re-organized in logarithmic time (O(log n)), which is much faster than re-sorting a list every time a score changes.

### Fisher-Yates Shuffle for Randomizing Questions

How it's used: To ensure fairness and a unique experience each time a quiz is played, the questions generated by the AI are shuffled into a random order. The Fisher-Yates algorithm shuffles the array of questions in linear time (O(n)), guaranteeing that every quiz session has a different, unpredictable question sequence.

### Hash Map for Session Management

How it's used: A Hash Map (or Dictionary) is essential for managing all active quiz rooms. The unique 6-character room code acts as the key, and the value is an object containing all session data (players, scores, current question, etc.). This provides near-instant (O(1) average time) lookups, insertions, and deletions, making it highly efficient to manage many simultaneous quiz sessions.


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you have:
- Node.js 18+ (18.17.0 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)
- Git (obviously)
- A decent code editor (VS Code is my go-to)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whizquiz.git
   cd whizquiz
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd app
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the `app` directory:
   ```env
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/whizquiz"
   
   # AI API
   LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   
   # NextAuth (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Generate Prisma client
   npx prisma generate
   
   # Run migrations
   npx prisma db push
   
   # (Optional) Seed with sample data
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

That's it! Head over to `http://localhost:3000` and start creating quizzes! ðŸŽ‰

##  How to Use

### Creating a Quiz
1. Click "Create Quiz" on the homepage
2. Enter your name as the host
3. Pick a topic from our curated list
4. Wait for the AI to generate questions (usually takes 10-15 seconds)
5. Share the room code with friends
6. Start the quiz when everyone's ready!

### Joining a Quiz
1. Click "Join Quiz" on the homepage
2. Enter the room code (it's that 6-character thing)
3. Add your name
4. Wait in the lobby for the host to start
5. Answer questions as fast as you can!

### Pro Tips
- **Speed matters**: You get bonus points for quick answers
- **Share smartly**: Use the copy link button - it handles all the clipboard nonsense
- **Mobile-friendly**: The UI adapts to your screen size, so quiz anywhere
- **Real-time updates**: Everything syncs automatically - no need to refresh

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Database connection failed"**
- Check your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.local`
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- Verify database credentials

**"Questions aren't generating"**
- Verify your `LLM_API_KEY` is correct
- Check network connectivity
- Look at the browser console for error messages


## Future Ideas

Some things I'm thinking about:
- **Custom quiz creation** - Let users add their own questions
- **Team mode** - Quiz with teams instead of individuals
- **Image questions** - Support for visual quiz questions
- **Quiz history** - Save and replay past quizzes
- **Difficulty levels** - Easy, medium, hard question variants
- **Time pressure modes** - Different timing challenges
